# Whiteboard Vue

## Description
Interactive application that works like a Whiteboard with Stickers.
The application allows you to move stickers around, add new ones, delete them and even edit them.

## Installation
1. Install packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Run dev version:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage
At the bottom of the page there is a navbar that contains 2 buttons. When you click on the hand button, it will turn on/off moving with the stickers. While sticker movement is on you cannot edit inputs or delete stickers. When the plus button is clicked, a new sticker is added to the page.
If you move the cursor over a sticker an X button will appear, which when clicked will delete that sticker.
Both the text in the stickers and the text at the top of the page are editable.
